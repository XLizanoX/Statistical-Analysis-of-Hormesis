Purpose of the Study
The goal of this repository is to provide tools for analyzing hormetic dose-response relationships using both polynomial and specialized hormesis models. These models are applicable to a wide range of biological and toxicological studies where hormesis is observed. Key objectives include:

Identifying the optimal dose range for growth stimulation.

Quantifying Ymax (maximum stimulation as a percentage of the control), Mmax (dose at which the maximum response occurs), and LDS (limited dose for stimulation).

Comparing the performance of different statistical models for analyzing hormesis.
