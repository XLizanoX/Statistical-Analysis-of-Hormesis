# Statistical-Analysis-of-Hormesis-Using-Polynomial-and-Hormesis-Models
This repository contains scripts for the statistical analysis of hormesis using polynomial models (quadratic and cubic) and specialized models (Cedergreen and Brain-Cousens). These scripts, written in R and SAS, enable the modeling of dose-response relationships and estimation of key parameters such as Ymax, Mmax, and LDS.
