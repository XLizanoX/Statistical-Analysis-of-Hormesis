These data were obtained experimentally at the Faculty of Chemical Sciences of Veracruz University. The data correspond to in vitro sugarcane cultures bio-stimulated with different doses (micromolar, µM) of neodymium nitrate (Nd(NO₃)₃. The study includes measurements of various growth and physiological parameters, such as plant height, leaf number, shoot and root characteristics, fresh and dry weight, chlorophyll content, carotenoids, and total soluble sugars.
